# AudiVa

AudiVa is an AI Voice Detector which can analyze audio files to check whether the file contains AI Generated audio or not.

The classification model used for AudiVa is a RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) based model which uses LSTM (Long short-term memory) as the base layer of the neural network.
It uses Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) values of audio files to analyze and classify the audio as Human or AI Generated.
